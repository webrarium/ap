                            — the philanthropic arm of Ascent Partners, has created a centralised
                            platform that consolidates all of Ascent Partners' philanthropic
                            activities, under the chairmanship of Mr Simon Mak, CEO of Ascent
                            Partners. This centralisation has led to streamlined management,
                            improved coordination, and a more efficient allocation of resources
                            within the foundation.

                    The decision to re-focus Ascent Partners' philanthropy activities reflects a
                    strategic shift in focus towards bridging the funding gap between new
                    ideas and sustainable NGOs in the education, environmental, and poverty
                    alleviation sectors. This shift demonstrates Ascent Partners' commitment
                    to addressing critical societal challenges and making a lasting impact in
                    these areas.

                            Our philosophy
                        </h2>
                        is based across three broad sectors: relief of poverty, education,
                        and environmental protection. Working with early-stage
                        start-ups that address any or all of these three core principles,
                        The Ascent Partners Foundation provides financing and, more
                        importantly, advice and network opportunities to those most in
                        need.

                        By working hand-in-hand with NGO’s and governments, Ascent Partners Foundation strives to be a
                        positive force in philanthropy. Examples of our work to help poverty relief include working with the
                        Refugee Union in Hong Kong for the “World without Strangers Charitable Fund’ to donate nearly 1,000
                        pieces of excess and unbranded items from Giordano in September 2023.

                        The Foundation has also funded the Asia Sustainability & ESG Research Centre Consortium (ASERCC),
                        founded by the Hong Kong Hang Seng University and other academic institutions which recently held a
                        three-day Sustainability and ESG Summit in Bangkok.

                        <br>
                        Finally, the foundation has also partnered with the Alliance for Responsible Forest Management (ARFM),
                        an international tropical forest management education NGO, to create a Hong Kong specific urban forest
                        management program, and supported them in attending the recent UNFCCC adoption committee
                        meetings in Seoul and Nairobi.
